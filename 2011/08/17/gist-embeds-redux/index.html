	<div class="entry-content"><p>When this blog was still on Tumblr, I blogged about <a href="/2010/10/20/embedding-github-gists-in-tumblr-posts/" title="Embedding GitHub Gists in Tumblr Posts">embedding GitHub Gists in Tumblr posts</a>. Doing so has a few advantages:</p>

<ol>
<li>You don&#8217;t have to sprinkle <code>script</code> tags throughout your <code>body</code>. You just include links (<code>a</code>-style) to your Gists and then a single script&mdash;referenced at the bottom of the document&mdash;does all the magic.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t have to include the default Gist stylesheet at all if you don&#8217;t want to. This is useful if your Gist styles are different and you don&#8217;t want to worry about using <code>!important</code> or making sure your selectors are more specific than theirs.</li>
<li>If the user has JavaScript disabled, they still see a link to the Gist.</li>
</ol>


<p>Back in those days, if I wanted a Gist in a post, I would make a new Gist for every piece of code I wanted to include. That got ugly, though, so I decided I would start making a single multi-file Gist per post, where each &#8220;file&#8221; was a separate piece of code to be used in the post. This required a few changes to the script.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I won&#8217;t include the previous script in this post, but you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/637764" title="gist: 637764 (gist.github.com)">get the Gist</a>. Basically what it does is look for paragraphs with a &#8220;gist&#8221; class that have Gist links in them. Something like:</p>

<p class="gist"><a href="http://gist.github.com/1153272#file_usage_before.html" data-file="usageBefore.html">Gist 1153272: usageBefore.html</a></p>


<p>Once it finds them, it turns the Gist webpage URL into a script URL for the corresponding Gist inclusion script and then replaces the paragraph with what the script would have written there. (And since it&#8217;s just a plain old link [instead of a <code>script</code>], users with JavaScript disabled will still see a link to the Gist.) You can read my <a href="/2010/10/20/embedding-github-gists-in-tumblr-posts/" title="Embedding GitHub Gists in Tumblr Posts">previous post</a> if you want more details on how the script actually works.</p>

<p>Both the webpage URLs and script URLs are capable of specifying a specific file within a Gist. For the webpage URLs, it&#8217;s just an anchor so that the browser scrolls to that file within the Gist. For the script URLs, it reduces the output of the script&#8217;s <code>document.write</code>s to that specific file.</p>

<p>So I basically needed to update my script&#8217;s logic to respect the file specification.</p>

<p>One small problem is that the two different URL formats have different formats for the filenames and they&#8217;re not interchangable. So, for example, say I have a Gist whose ID is 123 and it contains a file called firstFile.js. The webpage URL for that Gist and that specific file would be <code>http://gist.github.com/123#file_first_file.js</code>. The corresponding script URL would be <code>http://gist.github.com/123.js?file=firstFile.js</code>. Notice the difference in the filenames. The webpage URL replaces capital letters with an underscore and then the lowercase letter (<code>first_file.js</code>). While the script URL uses the original name (<code>firstFile.js</code>). And like I said before, they&#8217;re not interchangable: you can&#8217;t use the script URL format in webpage URLs or vice versa.</p>

<p>I got around this by adding a <code>data-file</code> attribute to the link to specify the filename to use when creating the script URL. So to include the example Gist above, your markup would look like:</p>

<p class="gist"><a href="http://gist.github.com/1153272#file_usage_after.html" data-file="usageAfter.html">Gist 1153272: usageAfter.html</a></p>


<p>So JavaScript-less users still see a valid link to the specific file. Otherwise, the script knows which file to request based on the <code>data-file</code> attribute. The script doesn&#8217;t have to worry about converting one filename format to the other. No thanks.</p>

<p>The result:</p>

<p class="gist"><a href="http://gist.github.com/1153272#file_gist.js" data-file="gist.js">Gist 1153272: gist.js</a></p>
